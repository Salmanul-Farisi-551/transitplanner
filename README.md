## Introduction

TransitPlanner is a Python based tool for planning and simulating observations of transiting exoplanets.

The goal of this project is to identify observable exoplanets within a given time window, apply simple observability rules, and generate basic synthetic transit light curves.

The project structure is inspired by established astronomy software and is intentionally kept modular so that each part can be extended or replaced later.
